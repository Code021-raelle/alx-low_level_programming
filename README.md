	Thanks to "Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie" for bringing C programming to the world.
	He was an American computer scientist, he is most well-known for creating the C programming language and with long term colleague Ken Thompson, the unix operating system and B programming language.

# What is C?
  C is an imperative (procedural) language. All the code has to be inside a function, C files are source code of your program.
  You have to compile C files with a compiler (for instance gcc) to create an executable file.

# Comments
  Begins with /* and ends with */
  and can be inserted anywhere a white-space character is allowed. Comments don't nest and also use comments to document your code.
  
# Functions
  A program is a collection of functions
  
  Functions:
	Sequence of program instructions that perform a specific task, packaged as a unit.
  	May take arguments as input information.
      	Compute something.
	May return a result.
	*Functions can call functions.*
  Parameters and return values must have a type.

# The entry point | main
  program starts with the entry point. In C, it's the main function, from the main function you can call other functions and when main returns the program stops.

# Strings
  "string" (double quotes). Evaluates to the address in memory of the first character of the string.
  	   Example: "Best School"

# Arrays
  A succession of items of the same type in memory.

# Structures
  A complete data type declaration that defines a physically grouped list of variables to be placed under one name in a block of memory.
